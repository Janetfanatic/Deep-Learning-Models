# Deep-Learning-Models
 Trained model to determine the future decisions of the company

## How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model?
For this project I utilized 10 layers and a total of 
## Were you able to achieve target model performance?
No, I was not able to achieve the target performace of greater than or equal to 75% accracy.

## What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Utilization of 500 epochs and Increased the layers, double the number of nodes for every other layer.
During compliing added a compiler code with an lr of 0.0005, and added a code 

## If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
