# Deep-Learning-Models
 Trained model to determine the future decisions of the company

## How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model?
For this project I utilized 10 input layers each with ReLu function and a total of 768 nodes.
A sigmond function was utilized for the output.

## Were you able to achieve target model performance?
No, I was not able to achieve the target performace of greater than or equal to 75% accracy but very close at 72%.

## What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
- Utilization of 500 epochs and Increased the layers, double the number of nodes for every other layer.
- During compliing added a compiler code with an lr of 0.0005, allowing the model to take small purposeful steps.

## If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
Random Forest Deep Learning
- It workes well with categoical data
- It combindes various models to make a stronger more robust model with increased accuracy.
